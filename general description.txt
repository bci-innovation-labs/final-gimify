There are services like PlayStation Network, App store and Google Play etc where people can buy games from and money reaches to the publisher/developer after deduction from these services. In order to be discoverable, studios spend huge amount of money for burst campaign which makes them visible and people download and if the content is good enough then people continue to play their game and only after they addicted to it, they start playing.The biggest challenge will still be to balance how much to continue to spend on sustaining campaign and how much return is it giving back to studios. Gone are the days when we used to make games and release and keep collecting $$$, now we have to live this game for long and the process is called Live Ops where we keep watching user trends (like stock market) and keep providing newer content, adjust in games currencies, interact heavily with our audience (community management), provide offers based on behaviour or event and keep challenging users to continue to be on our game. For example, Minecraft is a widely popular game with more than a million players online at any given time. Players began with a blank landscape, a few basic tools and learn to construct buildings brick-by-brick often until they have a whole empire. Leasing server space guarantees that they won't lose what they've built.
