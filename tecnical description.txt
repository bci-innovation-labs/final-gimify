	When I start the project, I whrote the html file first, because html is the base structure of the project, but just set the structure, but didn't add anything specific, and then, is the JS file. I use the model, views, modelviews method to do this(MVVC). Firstly, gather the information of different games, like companies name, games name, their img.

	After that, use octopus(modelviews) to make a link to the views and model, whick means make sure the views can call everythings of model.

	Last part is views, views include 2 small parts, first is gather information from model through octopus, and then, render it to the page. Which means put this kind of information to the html files.

	Last part is CSS file, can make the pages seems not so terrible.
	This is the whole process to finish our project.
